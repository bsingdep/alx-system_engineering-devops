<h2> 0-sniffing:  ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic </h2>
<p>Any information that is not encrypted and sniffed by an attacker can be seen by the attacker - that could be your email password or credit card information. While today’s network security is much stronger than it used to be, there are still some legacy systems that are using unencrypted communication means. A popular one is telnet.</P>
<p>In this project: I have used a tool called tcpdump to sniff the network traffic. tcpdump is a packet analyzer that is launched from the command line. It can be used to analyze network traffic by intercepting and displaying packets. The same thing can be also acheived using a GUI based packet sniffing tool called wireshark. </p>
<h2> 1-dictionary_attack: Dictionary attack </h2>
<p> Password-based authentication systems can be easily broken by using a dictionary attack. For this project I have used a tool called hydra for bruteforcing the passowrd-based authentication system. Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add.</p>
